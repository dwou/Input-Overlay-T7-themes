# Input-Overlay-T7-themes

Tekken-themed input overlays compatible with univrsal/input-overlay for OBS. Default controls are WASD/arrows for directions/1234. It would probably be easy to add scripts for setting binds.

## qwerty4 preset

screenshot at 90% opacity in OBS. qwerty5 preset is higher quality but the buttons are comparatively smaller. The fix for this is to use two instances of input-overlay running at once, one for arrows (implemented) and one for buttons (unimplemented but easy fix).
